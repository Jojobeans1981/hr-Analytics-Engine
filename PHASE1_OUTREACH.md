Hey [Name],

I built a tool that might help HR teams visualize employee data better, and I'd love your professional opinion.

It's called Prometheus - a dashboard that shows employee metrics with risk scoring. Takes 2 minutes to check out.

**Demo:** http://localhost:3001/api/demo/health
**Credentials:** demo / prometheus2025

Just 2 questions if you have 5 minutes:
1. Is this something HR would actually use?
2. What's missing or confusing?

No pressure at all - just need real human feedback!

Thanks,
Joe
